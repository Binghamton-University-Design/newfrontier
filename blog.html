					<h1>NFTs: Just Hype?</h1>

					<p>In just a few months, NFTs entered mainstream media by force to become one of the hottest topics of 2021. Elon Musk sang a song and minted it. Snoop Dogg released "A Journey with the Dogg", an NFT collection with art inspired by his childhood memories and an original song. The CEO of Twitter sold his first tweet for 2.9 million dollars. But just how concrete are these digital claims of ownership that seem to attract so much attention and wealth?</p>

					<p>One of the biggest and most controversial debates in art is the status of art reproductions. What gives the original work value if there are multiple reproductions of it being enjoyed by people everywhere? Physical artworks claim value not only through their perceived scarcity, but also the experience within which they are presented. What about digital artworks? With graphic design becoming a rich form of art, digital art is becoming more in demand.</p>

					<p>However, it is ridiculously easy to reproduce a digital artwork for cheap, if not free. Copy and Paste are two of the most utilized functions of the computer in the world, and in a digital world an artist has no real claim to their art. This is where NFTs come in. NFTs turn art into unique pieces of code that allow them to be distinguished as the originals in a haystack of identical copies.</p>

					<p>There is no real authority determining the authenticity of NFTs. Cryptocurrency is still an abstract idea awaiting adoption as an actual financial system. At any point, NFTs could lose their legitimacy if people begin to stop believing in the practical application of them.</p>
